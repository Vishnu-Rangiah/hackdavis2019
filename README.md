Meal Helper Demo - Hack Davis 2019 Winner - Android Studio

Our app lets the user input their data like weight, height, etc. Then it gets the DC menu for either lunch, dinner, breakfast, or late night from the DC website. Depending on if the user is trying to gain, lose, or maintain weight the app gives the user a list of the food options from the menu, with the top being the dish he/she should eat and the bottom being the dish he/she should avoid.
